### Project Status

- Sept, 18 2012: Just getting development started. (Don't bother downloading any code yet, friends.)

- Sept, 20 2012: Created the initial GUI. (The real work begins now.)

- Sept, 26 2012: Reconsidering platform. Tried HTML5 approach, and really like it. Not 100% committed either way yet, so I've separated the approaches into JavaDirection and HTML5Direction.
