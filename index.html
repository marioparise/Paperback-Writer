        <h3>Paperback Writer is a Mac/Windows/Linux application that makes it easy for novelists to publish their ebooks as a valid ePub file.</h3>

<p>As an aspiring author who has gone through the ebook publishing cycle, I was surprised by how difficult it is to create a good quality ebook. I ultimately had to dig into the code to create the quality I was seeking.</p>

<p>As I looked into why this was such a challenge, the answer became clear: Word processors like Microsoft Word or Apple's Pages (which are great) were never meant for ebook creation. They come with alot of baggage, such as handling hundreds of fonts, font sizes, tables, lists, columns, images and image placement... the feature list is huge. Any program that handles such a complex list of features must also have a very complex file format and structure to accomodate them. What's more, these programs are meant for the printed page. They deal with margins and page sizes and so forth - concepts that do not translate well to the electronic world.</p>

<p>Novels, by contrast, are simple. They deal with simple data: a table of contents, chapter titles, paragraphs. Sometimes you want to emphasize things with italics, bolds, or (much less likely for novels) underlines. That's about it.</p>

<p>Paperback Writer is a novel writing tool designed from the ground up for ebook publishing. It's a highly focused tool for a very specific purpose. It doesn't allow for any fancy formatting options. You only get what a novelist would typically require to write their story.</p>

<p>The result is a high-quality ebook that will work in your standard e-readers and can be submitted to self-publishing sites like Amazon or Lulu.</p>

<h3>Project Status</h3>

<p>Although this project has been in the planning stages since July 2012, it is just now (September 2012) beginning development. Accordingly there's not alot of code to show yet. But please check back soon!</p>

<h3>Want to help?</h3>

<p>At the moment, my biggest area of need is spreading the word and raising some funds.</p>

<p>For the latter, if you like this project and would like to support me during its development, <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/paberback-writer?a=1112581">I have an Indiegogo campaign setup here.</a>.</p>

<p>For the former, any help in spreading the word would be greatly appreciated. Tweets, blog posts, sky writing... whatever feels right.</p>

<p>As the project advances, I'll also be looking for alpha and beta testers, as well as developers more skilled than I to peak in on the development and let me know if they think I'm doing anything completely batshit wrong.</p>
